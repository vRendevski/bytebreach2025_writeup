# ByteBreach 2025.1 - Writeup

ByteBreach 2025.1 challenged participants with a series of sequential OSINT puzzles designed to test both technical acumen and creative problem-solving. In this writeup, I detail each step of my journey through the challenges, sharing insights and the lessons learned along the way.

---

## **Token 1: Subdomain Discovery**
### **Challenge Introduction**
Navigating to challenge.beyondmachines.net and clicking the `Start Challenge` button we get:
```
I have my suspicions...

Hey there. I think I've seen some people in the YieldCat.com team are building some other platform.

I think they are going to mess up the security, and you should investigate.

I know I'm sending you on a wild runaround. But so are the hackers, and they will start with some OSINT.

Just be very patient.
```
## **What Didnâ€™t Work & Why**
Initially, I assumed the challenge required OSINT on social media accounts related to the challenge. However, this approach yielded no useful results. A hint from @RevanchistX made me realize that OSINT includes DNS enumeration, which I had incorrectly assumed was active enumeration. Combining this insight with the hint that `the YieldCat.com team is building some other platform`, I decided to proceed with subdomain enumeration.

### **Step 1: Enumerating Subdomains from CT logs with crt.sh**
Since SSL/TLS certificates are publicly logged in **Certificate Transparency (CT) logs**, we can use **crt.sh** to check for any subdomains that have been issued certificates.

I performed a search on **crt.sh** using the domain `yieldcat.com`:
- **URL:** [https://crt.sh/?q=%.yieldcat.com](https://crt.sh/?q=%.yieldcat.com)  
- **Query Used:** `%.yieldcat.com` (Finds all subdomains of `yieldcat.com`)

<img src="images/crt_sh_output.png">

*Note: This method only works if a certificate for yieldcat.com (or its subdomains) has been issued and logged in Certificate Transparency (CT). Otherwise, alternative subdomain enumeration methods would be required.*

### **Step 2: Navigating the Subdomains and Decoding**
After testing the discovered subdomains, `runaround.yieldcat.com` returned a Base64-encoded response:
```Base64
eyJtZXNzYWdlIjogIkV2ZW4gaWYgaXQncyBub3QgRE5TLCBpdCdzIGFsd2F5cyBETlMiLCAiZGF0YSI6IHsiVG9rZW5fMSI6ICJBbmFfS2hvdXJpIiwgIkJyb2tlbl9LZXlfMSI6ICJTY3JpbSJ9fQ==
```
We can use various tools to decode the Base64 string, but I prefer [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/):
```json
{
  "message": "Even if it's not DNS, it's always DNS",
  "data": {
    "Token_1": "Ana_Khouri",
    "Broken_Key_1": "Scrim"
  }
}
```

---

## **Token 2: DNS Enumeration**

Using the hint provided in the `message` field of the previous JSON response I proceeded with DNS record enumeration:

I identified three intriguing TXT records that appeared to be encoded. Through trial and error, I determined that the first two were Base64-encoded, while the third was HEX-encoded.

Encoded:
```
QnJva2VuX0tleV8yOiBzaGF3
VG9rZW5fMjogQ2FsdmluX1N5bHZlc3Rl
49207468696e6b20796f75206e65656420746f207472792074686520506f73742061742072756e61726f756e64
```
Decoded:
```
Broken_Key_2: shaw
Token_2: Calvin_Sylveste
I think you need to try the Post at runaround
```

---

## **Token 3: POST request at runaround.yieldcat.com**

Using the hint from the previous token, I attempted a POST request to runaround.yieldcat.com
```bash
curl https://runaround.yieldcat.com -X POST
```
The response included a Base64 encoded string:
```
eyJtZXNzYWdlIjogIkkga2VlcCB0aGUgd2VhcG9ucyBjYWNoZSBpbiBteSBub3N0YWxnaWFmb3JpbmZpbml0eSBidWNrZXQgaW4gdGhlIHVzIGVhc3Qgb25lLCBpbiBhIHRleHQgYWJvdXQgcGF0dGVybl9qdWdnbGVycyIsICJkYXRhIjogeyJUb2tlbl8zIjogIk5ldmlsX0NsYXZhaW4iLCAiQnJva2VuX0tleV8zIjogIlN1aXQifX0=
```
Decoding it gives us:
```
{"message": "I keep the weapons cache in my nostalgiaforinfinity bucket in the us east one, in a text about pattern_jugglers", "data": {"Token_3": "Nevil_Clavain", "Broken_Key_3": "Suit"}}
```

---

## **Token 4: AES256 Decryption**

### **Step 1: Navigating to the S3 bucket** 

The challenge hint suggests that a 'weapons cache' is stored in an **S3 bucket** named **nostalgiaforinfinity** in the **us-east-1** region in a **txt** file named **pattern_jugglers**.
Amazon S3 buckets follow a standard URL format:
```
https://BUCKET_NAME.s3.REGION.amazonaws.com/
```
Substituting the given details:
```
https://nostalgiaforinfinity.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/pattern_jugglers.txt
```
Accessing the URL gives us:
```
I've been working hard to find the secrets. 

This is no longer a safe place to share data. 

I don't even want to leave stuff obvious so i put it in AES256 crypt. Do your work for the key, repetition is the mother of all knowledge: https://www.w3.org/History.html [1991/December/4]

```

### **Step 2: AES256 Key Derivation**
*Note: This token underwent several changes during the challenge. The current version of the token might be slightly different from the one in this writeup.*

This was, by far, the most challenging token in the challenge. Initially, I assumed the `broken_keys` provided with each token were meant to be used here. However, a quick test in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) ruled out this possibility.

I decided to take a step back and systematically analyze all the available information:
- We need to somehow derive the key.
- The key needs to be 32 characters long (256 bits = 32 bytes).
- We don't know what mode of AES was used (ECB, CBC, etc.).

Given the hint `repetition is the mother of all knowledge`, I inferred that the key might involve repeating a word until it reached 32 characters.

To derive the key, I focused on the provided webpage, `https://www.w3.org/History.html`, and the date `1991/December/4`. Upon navigating the page, I found a section titled *1991* and a subsection titled *December*, but there was no explicit mention of the number *4*. I later learned that the *'4'* in the 'date' represented the *4'th* word of the subsection.

During the challenge, I wrote a Python script to scrape every word from the site, repeated it until 32 characters and used it as a key in both ECB and CBC mode (with null bytes for the IV) and made sure it only contained ASCII characters. You can find the script attached to this repository.

#### To summarize:
I wrote a script to:
- Scrape every word from `https://www.w3.org/History.html`.
- Repeat it until 32 characters.
- Use it as a key in both ECB and CBC mode (with null byte IV).
- Stop if it contains only printable ASCII characters.

We have moved everything to https://run.mocky.io/v3/b75c97ae-53fe-4578-9f02-3fb0c7376d7a
But you MUST LOOK AT ALL THE DETAILS!!!

## **Token 5: Mock API Headers**
Navigating to `https://run.mocky.io/v3/b75c97ae-53fe-4578-9f02-3fb0c7376d7a` we are met with a mock API.
```
{
  "api_version": "2.1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-02T12:34:56Z",
  "search_results": {
    "primary_endpoints": [
      {
        "service": "authentication",
        "endpoint": "https://api.security-challenge.com/v2/auth",
        "deprecated": false,
        "notes": "Check documentation for OAuth2 implementation"
      },
      {
        "service": "key_management",
        "endpoint": "https://keystore.security-challenge.com/latest",
        "deprecated": true,
        "migration_date": "2024-12-31"
      }
    ],
    "potential_matches": [
      {
        "id": "TK_8675309",
        "location": "gs://security-bucket-v2/tokens/archived/",
        "access_level": "restricted",
        "last_updated": "2024-11-15"
      }
<SNIPPED>
```
Initially, I thought this token required finding a Microsoft or Google Cloud storage link or a hidden page on runaround.yieldcat.com. However, the solution was hiding in plain sight within the HTTP headers. Intercepting the request with Burp Suite we get token 5:

## **Token 6: Docker and GPG decryption**

### **Step 1: Pulling the Docker Continer and Enumerating files**
The previous token hints toward a docker container named `beyondmachines/working_image_1:latest`.
With Docker installed, we can pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull beyondmachines/working_image_1:latest
```
Once the image is pulled, we can run the container:
```
docker run -it beyondmachines/working_image_1:latest /bin/sh
```
This will drop us into an interactive shell within the container. Listing the current directory we get the following output:
```bash
# ls -la
total 24
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Feb  2 17:49 .
drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Feb 12 19:18 ..
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root           366 Feb  2 17:49 Dockerfile
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root           417 Feb  2 17:41 app.py
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root           114 Feb  2 17:42 final_token.txt.gpg
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root             5 Feb  2 17:41 requirements.txt
```

### **Step 2: GPG file decryption**
Since this was the final token, I deduced that the `broken_keys` had to be used to decrypt the GPG file using the following command:
```
gpg --decrypt secrets.gpg
```
Using `ScrimshawSuitMorwenna` as the passphrase, I decrypted the file to reveal the final token:
```
Token_6: Schuyler_Sky_Haussmann
```
