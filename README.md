# ByteBreach 2025.1 Writeup Repository

Welcome to the **ByteBreach 2025.1 Writeup Repository**! This repository contains my detailed writeup, scripts, and visuals for solving the **ByteBreach 2025.1** challenge, a series of sequential OSINT puzzles designed to test technical acumen and creative problem-solving skills.

## **Contents**
This repository includes:
- **Writeup**: A comprehensive Markdown file (`writeup.md`) documenting my journey through the challenges, including the steps taken, tools used, and lessons learned.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts and other code snippets used to solve specific challenges (e.g., AES key derivation).
- **Visuals**: Screenshots and images referenced in the writeup to provide additional context and clarity.

## **Challenge Overview**
ByteBreach 2025.1 consisted of six sequential tokens, each requiring a combination of OSINT techniques, cryptography, and system enumeration. The challenges included:
1. **Subdomain Discovery**
2. **DNS Enumeration**
3. **POST Request Analysis**
4. **AES256 Decryption**
5. **Mock API Header Inspection**
6. **Docker and GPG Decryption**

Each token built upon the previous one, creating a cohesive and engaging puzzle that reinforced the importance of methodical problem-solving in cybersecurity.

## **How to Use This Repository**
1. **Read the Writeup**: Start with the `writeup.md` file for a step-by-step breakdown of how I solved each challenge.
2. **Explore the Scripts**: Check out the scripts used for tasks like AES key derivation and subdomain enumeration.
3. **Review the Visuals**: Refer to the images and screenshots for additional context and verification.

## **Acknowledgments**
Special thanks to the ByteBreach organizers for creating such an engaging challenge and to the cybersecurity community for their support and insights.
